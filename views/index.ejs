            Adlerian psychology doesn't see compliments as inherently bad, but
            warns against relying on them for self-worth. We naturally seek
            belonging and significance, often through external validation like
            compliments. While these can temporarily boost self-esteem, they can
            create problems. Overdependence on compliments makes your sense of
            worth fragile and dependent on others' opinions, leading to anxiety
            when validation is absent. Compliments often focus on achievements,
            fostering a results-oriented mindset that can overshadow the
            intrinsic value of effort and personal growth. Additionally,
            excessive praise can discourage individuals from striving for
            improvement, making them feel they've already "peaked." Instead,
            Adlerian psychology suggests focusing on internal validation,
            recognizing your own efforts and progress regardless of external
            feedback. This builds resilience and encourages intrinsic
            motivation, leading to a more stable and fulfilling sense of
            self-worth. However, compliments can still be valuable as positive
            reinforcement, especially for children. The key lies in using them
            alongside encouragement for effort and intrinsic growth.
